### Getting started

At the moment scrypt-lite is not ready to release. If you want to use/test it, you have ti build it yourself.

> Note: I do not recommend to use a self-built version of scrypt-lite on important files.



#### How to build



**Requirements:**

- linux
- git
- g++



**Building:**

Just run the `build.sh` file in the repository root. If everything succeeds you will find the binary in the `bin/` directory. You can move it to `/bin` or `/sbin` or somewhere else to use it from terminal just like `ls` or `cd`.
