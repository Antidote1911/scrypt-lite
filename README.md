### Getting started

**Either:**

1. Go to Releases
2. Search for the newest version and download it
3. Extract it
4. Run the binary or run `install.sh`
5. Thats it

**Or:**

- Build it yourself as explained further on

> Note: I do not recommend to use a self-built version of scrypt-lite.



### How to build


**Requirements:**

- linux
- git
- g++
- zip



**Building:**

- Make sure you meet all the requirements
- Clone the repository
- The file `build.sh` can build just the **binary** or a **full release package**. Just add a version number as an argument to build it. Example: `./build.sh RELEASE-1.2`
- If you have built a release package, just use it like the official ones.
